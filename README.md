<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, I deployed a sample application to to the Apache Web Server running on EC2 instances inside a Private Subnet using the CloudFormation Template ie. Infrastructure as a Code. Some of the properties used in this project are as follows :
Property | Value |
---|---|
Number of web servers | 4-6 |
Region | us-east-1 ie. North Virginia
Number of availability Zones Useed | 2
Subnet | Private
Instance Type | t2.micro |
AMI | Ubuntu18 |
Disk Space | 10GB

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here are the steps needed to successfully finish this project. 

### Prerequisites

1. AWS account: You would require to have an AWS account to be able to build cloud infrastructure.
2. AWS CLI - You need to have AWS CLI installed and profile configured in order to run the AWS commands. You can download the AWS-CLI [**here**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
3. VS code editor: This editor is helpful to visualize image as well as the code. You can download VS Code editor [**here**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
4. An account on LucidChart: In order to draw the Architecture Diagrams, you need to have a user account on [**Lucid Chart**](www.lucidchart.com) 


### How to run the scripts?
1. Create Script   
```bash
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured before running the command below
./create.sh stackName templateFile.yml variableFile.json
```

2. Update Script
```bash
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured before running the command below
./update.sh stackName templateFile.yml variableFile.json
```   

3. Delete Script
```bash
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured before running the command below
./delete.sh stackName
```  

### Steps

1. ***Creating Network Stack.*** <br>
Firstly, we create the Network stack using the following command :
```bash
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured before running the command below
./create.sh networkStack network.yml parameters-network.json

# This should give back the ARN of the created Stack
```  
   
2. ***Creating Server Stack.***<br>
Once network stack is created, we then create the server stack which using some of the resources created in the Network Stack.
```bash
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured before running the command below
./create.sh serverStack servers.yml parameters-server.json

# This should give back the ARN of the created Stack
```

<!-- DEMO-ACCESSING THE WEBSITE -->
## Demo-Accessing the Website 
* Once both the stacks are created, we can use the LoadBalancer DNS Name to access the website that is deployed on the EC2 instances in private subnets.
* To demonstrate the working of LoadBalancer, I have displayed the Private IP of the webserver on the top of the page.
* We can see that the IP address is changing which shows that the LoadBalancer is distributing the traffic across all the web servers ðŸ‘‡
